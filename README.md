# Parrot shell .bashrc
A color-fixed version of the .bashrc file of the italian ParrotOS operating system. When a wrong command is executed, or an error occures, the square brackets are now red instead of white.

I don't know if this is an error or is on purpose, but i hate to see two white square brackets when all the others components are red.
