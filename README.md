# Parrot shell .bashrc
A color-fixed version of the .bashrc file of the italian ParrotOS operating system.
When a wrong command is executed, or an error occures, the square brackets are now red instead of white.

This is how the original shell is:
![](docs/img/err.png)
This is how we fixed:
![](docs/img/correct.png)
I don't know if this is an error or is on purpose, but we thought that seeing two white square brackets, when all the other components are red, is not that good.

@Biagio00 and I have modified the .bashrc file.
